>## Project Description
GasAndMe description: This is a proposed solution (Web and Mobile App) for LPG(Cooking Gas) retailing across Africa. The switch from other cooking means to gas is growing rapidly and the retailers are still largely separated from the final consumers in Africa. This solution would provide a meeting point for Bulk Seller, Retailers and Final Consumers. It is expected to ease and enhance the productivity of the LPG sector and business.

> ## Tech Stack
The stacks used for the project include:

| <b><u>Technology</u></b> | <b><u>Used for</u></b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| **`PHP`** | Programming language |
| **`Laravel`** | General backend |
| **`Mongo Db`** | Database |
| **` HTML`** | Frontend Markup |
| **`CSS`** | Stlying |
| **`JavaScript`** | Frontend Programming |


> ## Initial Backend Repo Setup

The Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository was forked and cloned to create a copy on my local machine. 

```bash
# git clone git@github.com:pauline-banye/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
I changed directory to the cloned repo and set the original Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository as my "upstream" and the forked repo as the "origin".

```bash
# git remote add upstream git@github.com:zuri-training/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
The next step  involved editing the read.me file and adding it to git to track changes. I created the first commit `git commit -m "updated readme.md"`.

```bash
$ git commit -m "updated readme.md"
[main a4c9702] updated readme.md
 1 file changed, 197 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 rewrite README.md (100%)
```

Using `git push origin main`, the commit was pushed to the remote origin repository. Finally a pull request was initialized  to push my edits to the upstream repo
