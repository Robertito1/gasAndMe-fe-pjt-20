>## Project Description
GasAndMe description: This is a proposed solution (Web and Mobile App) for LPG(Cooking Gas) retailing across Africa. The switch from other cooking means to gas is growing rapidly and the retailers are still largely separated from the final consumers in Africa. This solution would provide a meeting point for Bulk Seller, Retailers and Final Consumers. It is expected to ease and enhance the productivity of the LPG sector and business.
